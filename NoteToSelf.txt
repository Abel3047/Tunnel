So this is where I will be putting all my thoughts as I create this program as a whole.
They will be mostly Ideas and thought processes as I go along. The biggest issue with this is, I'm not sure the best 
way to organize this. So we will see as we go along.


Features:

-The first thing worth noting its that I intend to have the database be organized with Dbsets. But They will all be the same type; Tunnels.
This way I will be easy to acess the web like nodes of the database from entry. But research into how the web works might give more fruitful
architecture.




Ideas:



Lessons:
-Methods themselves can take Type arguments ('T'). So that they can do what they would for a specific T
-partial classes are basically classes that when compiled are essentially combined. So you would use this to break up a class into different
functionality like, business logic and UI design logic.
-Business logic is basically controller; How the information is handled to and fro the database and the User interface
-To remove a file from the git changes(adding it to the git ignore) you should use the command git rm --cached <file>. This 'deletes' from the index but 
keeps the file. If you don't put the --cached tag however, it will actually delete the file from the folder
