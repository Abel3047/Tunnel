So this is where I will be putting all my thoughts as I create this program as a whole.
They will be mostly Ideas and thought processes as I go along. The biggest issue with this is, I'm not sure the best 
way to organize this. So we will see as we go along.


Features:

-The first thing worth noting its that I intend to have the database be organized with Dbsets. But They will all be the same type; Tunnels.
This way I will be easy to acess the web like nodes of the database from entry. But research into how the web works might give more fruitful
architecture.




Ideas:



Lessons:
-Methods themselves can take Type arguments ('T'). So that they can do what they would for a specific T
-partial classes are basically classes that when compiled are essentially combined. So you would use this to break up a class into different
functionality like, business logic and UI design logic.
-Business logic is basically controller; How the information is handled to and fro the database and the User interface
-To remove a file from the git changes(adding it to the git ignore) you should use the command git rm --cached <file>. This 'deletes' from the index but 
keeps the file. If you don't put the --cached tag however, it will actually delete the file from the folder
-When using Generic Type parameters you have to use the naming convection 'TType'. Eg TAppUser or TWeapon. This is so you can be more descriptive about what kind of types 
are going in.
-A Fluent interface is an API that basically chains methods one after another, using the result of each method as the context or entity that will fire off the next one.

-EF and EF Core do not have the functionality to have classes with type parameters to be navigated. And there doesn't seem to be an explicit way to set the navigation propterty

So what I am planning to do is to scratch the AbstractTunnel and just have Tunnel. Everything will inherit from this and it will be important for them to have their constructors
derive from the superclass constructor so that it can creat the TunnelId and default name for each of them.
